1) What does h(19685) return for the following function definition?

    def h(x):
      (d,n) = (1,0)
      while d <= x:
        (d,n) = (d*3,n+1)
      return(n)
Ans: 10

2) What is g(36) - g(35), given the definition of g below?

    def g(n): 
      s=0
      for i in range(2,n):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
      return(s)
Ans: 5

3) Consider the following function f.

    def f(n): 
      s=0
      for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n//i == i and n%i == 0:
           s = 1
      return(s%2 == 1)

  The function f(n) given above returns True for a positive number n if and only if:

 (a) n is an odd number.
 (b) n is a prime number.
 (c) n is a perfect square.
 (d) n is a composite number.
 Ans: (c)
 Feedback:
 f(n) sets s to 1 if there is a number i such that i*i == n.

4) Consider the following function fpp.

  def foo(m):
    if m == 0:
      return(0)
    else:
      return(m+foo(m-1))
Which of the following is correct?

 (a) The function always terminates with f(n) = factorial of n
 (b) The function always terminates with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
 (c) The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = factorial of n
 (d) The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
Ans: (d)
Feedback:
If m is negative, the function does not terminate. Otherwise, it computes 1+2+..+m = m(m+1)/2.
